Description: A minimal seat management daemon, and a universal seat management library
 A seat management library allowing applications to use whatever seat management is
 available. It supports:
  - seatd
  - (e)logind
  - embedded seatd for standalone operation
 Each backend can be compile-time included and is runtime auto-detected or manually
 selected with the LIBSEAT_BACKEND environment variable. Which backend is in use is
 transparent to the application, providing a simple common interface.
 .
 This package contains the development files.

 This package contains the seatd binary. It's a seat management daemon, that does
 everything it needs to do. Nothing more, nothing less.
